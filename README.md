Partial replacement for Windows 10 Family Safety

Windows 10 Family Safety can be extremely unreliable.  It might work for a couple of weeks and then just stop altogether - with no warning, error messages, or anything that might let a parent know that it has failed.

This is a partial replacement - with it you can manage a child's logon hours.

You can set how many hours per day a child can log on, and what hours are available for the child.

For example:
On Saturday and Sunday the child can log on for a total of 6 hours between 8am and 9:30pm
On Monday to Friday the child can log on for a total of 3.5 hours.  This can be any time between 6am and 7am or between 6pm and 10pm.

At the moment there are some extremely rough edges.  The most noticeable is that configuring the system is very slow.
See the issues list for a more detailed list.
